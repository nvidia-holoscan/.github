# NVIDIA Holoscan

[NVIDIA Holoscan](https://developer.nvidia.com/holoscan-sdk) is the AI sensor processing platform that combines hardware systems for low-latency sensor and network connectivity, optimized libraries for data processing and AI, and core microservices to run streaming, imaging, and other applications, from embedded to edge to cloud. It can be used to build streaming AI pipelines for a variety of domains, including Medical Devices, High Performance Computing at the Edge, Industrial Inspection, Robotics, and more.

The Holoscan platform consists of:

## Note

In previous releases, the prefix [`Clara`](https://developer.nvidia.com/industries/healthcare) was used to define Holoscan as a platform designed initially for [medical devices](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/clara/developer-kits/). As Holoscan has grown, its potential to serve other areas has become apparent. Starting with version 0.4.0 of the Holoscan SDK, Holoscan is now officially built to be domain-agnostic and can be used to build sensor AI applications in multiple domains. Going forward, domain specific content will be hosted on the [HoloHub](https://github.com/nvidia-holoscan/holohub) repository.
